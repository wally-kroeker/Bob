### Version History

<details>
<summary><strong>📅 v1.2.0 - Skills-as-Containers Migration 🔥 ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE</strong></summary>

**The Problem:**
Commands were scattered in a flat global namespace (`~/.claude/commands/`), making it hard to discover related functionality, maintain consistency, and understand domain boundaries. The architecture needed hierarchical organization that matched how capabilities are naturally grouped.

**The Solution:**
Complete migration to Skills-as-Containers pattern:
- Moved 73 commands into skill-specific `workflows/` subdirectories
- Enhanced 21 skills with proper workflow organization
- Established deprecation pattern for future architectural upgrades
- Documented the complete migration process

**What Changed:**
```
Before (v0.6.0):
~/.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── write-blog.md
│   ├── publish-blog.md
│   ├── quick-research.md
│   ├── extensive-research.md
│   └── [75+ scattered commands]
└── skills/
    ├── blogging/SKILL.md
    └── research/SKILL.md

After (v1.2.0):
~/.claude/
├── commands/               # Empty (commands moved to skills)
└── skills/
    ├── blogging/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   └── workflows/
    │       ├── write.md
    │       └── publish.md
    └── research/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── workflows/
            ├── quick.md
            └── extensive.md
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ Domain knowledge colocated with workflows
- ✅ Clear ownership and responsibility
- ✅ Natural language routing: Skills → Workflows
- ✅ Easier discovery of related capabilities
- ✅ Better encapsulation of domain context

**Migration Stats:**
- 73 commands migrated to skill workflows
- 21 skills enhanced with workflows/ directories
- 1 new skill created (content-enhancement)
- Commands directory reduced from 75 files to 0
- Zero errors, 100% QA pass rate
- Complete in ~25 minutes using parallel agents

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for Skills-as-Containers pattern
- Deprecation pattern established in `history/upgrades/deprecated/`
- Complete migration audit trail preserved

<summary><strong>📅 v0.6.0 - Repository Restructure with .claude/ Directory 🔥 MAJOR UPDATE</strong></summary>

**The Problem:**
Users reported issues with PAI not working correctly because the repository structure didn't match the actual working system. The real PAI system expects all infrastructure to live in `~/.claude/`, but the repo had everything at root level. This caused confusion and compatibility problems.

**The Solution:**
Complete repository restructure to mirror the actual working system:
- Created `.claude/` directory at repository root
- Moved ALL PAI infrastructure into `.claude/` (agents, commands, documentation, hooks, skills, voice-server, etc.)
- Kept GitHub infrastructure at root (README, LICENSE, .gitignore, .github, etc.)
- Repository now serves as a true reference implementation

**What Changed:**
```
Before (v0.5.0):
/PAI/
├── agents/
├── commands/
├── documentation/
├── hooks/
├── skills/
├── voice-server/
├── settings.json
├── .mcp.json
├── setup.sh
└── README.md

After (v0.6.0):
/PAI/
├── .claude/                 # ← NEW: All PAI infrastructure here
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── documentation/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── voice-server/
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── .mcp.json
│   └── setup.sh
├── README.md               # GitHub infrastructure stays at root
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Proper Emulation:** Repository now accurately represents how PAI works in production
2. **Easier Setup:** Users can see exactly how their `~/.claude/` directory should be structured
3. **Less Confusion:** Clear separation between GitHub files and PAI infrastructure
4. **Better Documentation:** Structure itself serves as documentation
5. **Reference Implementation:** Can be copied/referenced directly for setup

**Migration:**
- No action required for existing installations
- New users get the correct structure from the start
- All documentation updated to reflect new paths

**Rationale:**
The PAI system is designed to live in `~/.claude/` on your system. By organizing the repository to mirror this structure, we make it immediately clear how PAI should be set up. This is especially important for new users who are trying to understand the system architecture and for contributors who need to know where files belong.

<summary><strong>📅 v0.5.0 - Skills-Based PAI Architecture (92.5% Token Reduction)</strong></summary>

**Major Architectural Improvement:**
- **Zero hook overhead** - Eliminated all context loading from UserPromptSubmit hook
- **92.5% token reduction** - From 4000 tokens/interaction to 300 tokens
- **Pure skills architecture** - Core identity in skill description (always in system prompt)
- **On-demand context** - Full context loaded only when explicitly needed

**What Changed:**
- Added YAML frontmatter to `skills/CORE/SKILL.md` with comprehensive system description
- Core identity + critical security now in skill description (always present)
- Removed `MINIMAL.md` entirely (no longer needed)
- Hook renamed to `update-tab-titles.ts` (only handles tab titles, zero context)
- Flat file structure in `skills/CORE/` (no `/contexts` subdirectory)

**Architecture:**
- **Tier 1 (Always On):** Skill description in system prompt (~300 tokens) - identity, critical security, architecture explanation
- **Tier 2 (On Demand):** `SKILL.md` body loaded when PAI skill invoked (~4000 tokens) - contacts, preferences, voice IDs, detailed security
- **Hook:** Only updates tab titles (0 tokens context overhead)

**Benefits:**
- Cleanest possible architecture - fully embraces Claude Code skills system
- Context always relevant - skill description always present, full context on-demand
- Easy to customize - clear YAML frontmatter with `[CUSTOMIZE:]` markers
- Scales efficiently - adding content doesn't multiply token costs

**Files:**
- `skills/CORE/SKILL.md` - Full context with YAML frontmatter
- `skills/CORE/contacts.md` - Contact templates
- `skills/CORE/preferences.md` - Stack preferences templates
- `skills/CORE/response-format.md` - Response format templates
- `skills/CORE/security-detailed.md` - Security procedures
- `skills/CORE/voice-ids.md` - Voice system configuration (optional)
- `hooks/update-tab-titles.ts` - Tab title updates only

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

**Want to understand how PAI really works?**

PAI is built on four core primitives that work together: **Skills**, **Commands**, **Agents**, and **MCPs**. Understanding this architecture is essential for customizing PAI or building your own AI infrastructure.

### The Four Primitives

- **💡 Skills:** Meta-containers for domain expertise (e.g., Content Creation, Research, Development)
  - Package workflows, knowledge, and procedural guidance
  - Use progressive disclosure (metadata → instructions → resources) to prevent context bloat
  - Auto-load based on natural language triggers

- **⚡ Workflows:** Discrete task workflows within Skills (in `workflows/` subdirectory)
  - Self-contained, step-by-step workflows
  - Like "exported functions" from a Skill module
  - Auto-selected by natural language or invoked explicitly

- **🤖 Agents:** Orchestration workers for parallelization
  - Primarily invoke Skills/Commands (not standalone knowledge bases)
  - Enable parallel execution of independent tasks
  - Best for background work where results are logged

- **🔌 MCPs vs Direct Code:** Implementation flexibility
  - Use MCPs for standardized platform services (Chrome, Apify, etc.)
  - Use direct API code for domain-specific integrations
  - Choose based on your infrastructure scale and needs

### How They Fit Together

```
User Intent → Natural Language Trigger
    ↓
SKILL (Container for Domain)
    ↓
WORKFLOW (Specific Task - in workflows/ subdirectory)
    ↓
Implementation (Direct Code or MCPs)
    ↑
Invoked by AGENTS (for parallelization)
```

### Real-World Example

```
User: "Do extensive research on AI agent planning"
  ↓
Research Skill (domain expertise) loads
  ↓
workflows/extensive-research.md (workflow file) selected
  ↓
Launches 24 parallel researcher agents
  ↓
Each agent uses research strategies from Skill
  ↓
Results consolidated and saved
```

### Why This Matters

PAI's architecture **perfectly aligns** with Anthropic's official Skills framework while extending it with production-tested patterns:
- ✅ Progressive disclosure prevents context bloat
- ✅ Natural language routing (no command memorization)
- ✅ Parallel agent execution for speed
- ✅ Modular and composable design

📖 **[Read the full architecture documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** to understand:
- When to use each primitive
- Design patterns from production use
- Comparison with Anthropic's framework
- Decision trees for architectural choices
- Best practices and anti-patterns

This architecture scales from simple single-task workflows to complex multi-agent systems while maintaining clarity and efficiency.

## 🎯 **What is PAI?**

> **Core Mission:** Augment humans with AI capabilities so they can survive and thrive in a world full of AI.

## 🌍 **The Problem**

<div align="center">

> ### It doesn't matter how powerful AI becomes if it's not accessible to everyone

</div>

Right now, AI is trapped behind corporate APIs, expensive subscriptions, and complex interfaces that only developers can use. Meanwhile, billions of people who could benefit from AI augmentation—artists, teachers, small business owners, researchers, parents—are left behind.

PAI exists to solve this. This project's goal is to give the most powerful AI capabilities, in the form of a complete platform, to everyone on Earth. Not just the tech elite. Not just the wealthy. Everyone.

### 🎯 **How Skills Work**

**Skills activate automatically based on your intent:**

- **Say:** "Research the latest AI developments"
  **→** `research` skill loads → Launches parallel Perplexity/Claude/Gemini researchers

- **Say:** "Build a task tracker app"
  **→** `development` skill loads → Invokes architect and engineer agents

- **Say:** "Create a threat model"
  **→** `fabric` skill loads → Selects `create_threat_model` pattern from 242+ options

**Each skill contains:**
- 📄 Intent triggers ("USE WHEN...")
- 📁 Workflows subdirectory (specific tasks)
- 🤖 Specialized agents (if needed)
- 🔌 MCP integrations (if needed)
- 📖 Assets and examples

> [!TIP]
> **You don't manage agents or commands directly.** Just tell PAI what you want to do, and the right skill activates with all necessary resources.

### 💡 **Example Skills (Included)**

| Skill | What It Does | Example Usage |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **🔍 research** | Multi-source research with parallel agents | "Research quantum computing trends" |
| **🧵 fabric** | 242+ AI patterns (threat modeling, summarization, extraction) | "Create a threat model for our API" |

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

**Automated Setup:**
```bash
./.claude/setup.sh  # Interactive setup script (recommended)
```

**Or read:** [Getting Started Guide](./.claude/documentation/how-to-start.md) | [Quick Reference](./.claude/documentation/QUICK-REFERENCE.md)

> [!NOTE]
> PAI was originally built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but the architecture supports any AI platform (GPT, Gemini, etc.)
> Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) JavaScript runtime for the current implementation.

### **Manual Installation**

#### **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**

```bash
# Install Bun (JavaScript runtime)
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun 

# Get Claude Code (AI interface)
# Visit: https://claude.ai/code
```

#### **Step 2: Clone PAI Repository**

```bash
# Clone the PAI repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure

# All PAI infrastructure is now in .claude/ directory
ls -la .claude/  # See agents/, skills/, commands/, etc.
```

#### **Step 3: Copy .claude/ to Your Home Directory**

```bash
# Copy the .claude directory to your home directory
cp -r .claude ~/.claude

# OR create a symbolic link if you want to keep it in the repo
# ln -s ${PAI_DIR}/.claude ~/.claude
```

#### **Step 4: Configure PAI Directory Variable** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You MUST configure the PAI_DIR variable to point to your PAI installation directory.**
> This makes the PAI system completely agnostic to your installation location.

```bash
# Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
# Replace /path/to/PAI with YOUR actual PAI installation path
export PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"  # Point to the PAI repository root
export PAI_HOME="$HOME"  # Your home directory

# Example (adjust to YOUR installation path):
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Projects/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Documents/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="/Users/yourname/PAI"

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Step 5: Configure Environment & API Keys**

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp ~/.claude/.env.example ~/.claude/.env

# Configure your API keys
vim ~/.claude/.env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Some skills and agents require API keys to function:**
>

#### **Step 6: Launch PAI**

```bash
# Optional: Set up voice notifications (macOS only)
# Download Premium/Enhanced voices from System Settings → Voice (Live Speech)
# Then start the voice server:
cd ~/.claude/voice-server && bun server.ts &
# See ~/.claude/documentation/VOICE-SETUP-GUIDE.md for detailed setup instructions

# Open Claude Code and start using PAI!
# Your personal AI infrastructure is ready 🚀
```

### **⚙️ Environment Variables**

```bash
# ============ REQUIRED CONFIGURATION ============
PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"                  # PAI repository root (system agnostic)
PAI_HOME="$HOME"                        # Your home directory

# ============ RESEARCH AGENTS (Skills-Specific) ============
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_key"          # For perplexity-researcher agent
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"              # For gemini-researcher agent
# Claude WebSearch built-in - no key needed for claude-researcher

# ============ AI GENERATION (Optional) ============
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token"       # For Flux, Sora, etc.
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"              # For GPT integration, Sora billing

# ============ SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ============
PORT="8888"                             # Voice server port (default: 8888)

# ============ DIGITAL ASSISTANT CUSTOMIZATION ============
DA="YourAssistantName"                  # Your AI assistant's name (default: "Assistant")
DA_COLOR="purple"                       # Display color (purple, blue, green, cyan, etc.)
```

> [!TIP]
> **Why PAI_DIR is Important:** The PAI_DIR variable makes the entire PAI system portable and installation-agnostic. All commands, skills, and hooks reference `${PAI_DIR}` instead of hardcoded paths. This means you can install PAI anywhere on your system, and as long as PAI_DIR points to your PAI repository root, everything will work seamlessly.
