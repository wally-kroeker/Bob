<summary><strong>📅 v0.5.0 - Skills-Based PAI Architecture (92.5% Token Reduction)</strong></summary>

**Major Architectural Improvement:**
- **Zero hook overhead** - Eliminated all context loading from UserPromptSubmit hook
- **92.5% token reduction** - From 4000 tokens/interaction to 300 tokens
- **Pure skills architecture** - Core identity in skill description (always in system prompt)
- **On-demand context** - Full context loaded only when explicitly needed

**What Changed:**
- Added YAML frontmatter to `skills/PAI/SKILL.md` with comprehensive system description
- Core identity + critical security now in skill description (always present)
- Removed `MINIMAL.md` entirely (no longer needed)
- Hook renamed to `update-tab-titles.ts` (only handles tab titles, zero context)
- Flat file structure in `skills/PAI/` (no `/contexts` subdirectory)

**Architecture:**
- **Tier 1 (Always On):** Skill description in system prompt (~300 tokens) - identity, critical security, architecture explanation
- **Tier 2 (On Demand):** `SKILL.md` body loaded when PAI skill invoked (~4000 tokens) - contacts, preferences, voice IDs, detailed security
- **Hook:** Only updates tab titles (0 tokens context overhead)

**Benefits:**
- Cleanest possible architecture - fully embraces Claude Code skills system
- Context always relevant - skill description always present, full context on-demand
- Easy to customize - clear YAML frontmatter with `[CUSTOMIZE:]` markers
- Scales efficiently - adding content doesn't multiply token costs

**Files:**
- `skills/PAI/SKILL.md` - Full context with YAML frontmatter
- `skills/PAI/contacts.md` - Contact templates
- `skills/PAI/preferences.md` - Stack preferences templates
- `skills/PAI/response-format.md` - Response format templates
- `skills/PAI/security-detailed.md` - Security procedures
- `skills/PAI/voice-ids.md` - Voice system configuration (optional)
- `hooks/update-tab-titles.ts` - Tab title updates only

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📅 v0.4.0 - Repository Restructure 🔥 BREAKING CHANGE</strong></summary>

**⚠️ Breaking Changes:**

## 🎯 **What is PAI?**

> **Core Mission:** Augment humans with AI capabilities so they can survive and thrive in a world full of AI.

## 🌍 **The Problem**

<div align="center">

> ### It doesn't matter how powerful AI becomes if it's not accessible to everyone

</div>

Right now, AI is trapped behind corporate APIs, expensive subscriptions, and complex interfaces that only developers can use. Meanwhile, billions of people who could benefit from AI augmentation—artists, teachers, small business owners, researchers, parents—are left behind.

PAI exists to solve this. This project's goal is to give the most powerful AI capabilities, in the form of a complete platform, to everyone on Earth. Not just the tech elite. Not just the wealthy. Everyone.

**PAI is an open-source, full personal AI platform that's completely agnostic to who you are and what you're trying to accomplish.**

Think of PAI as your personal AI that actually knows you—all your projects, your style, your data—and can handle anything you throw at it. Whether you're an artist transitioning to independence, a founder building a company, or someone managing complex health needs, PAI becomes whatever you need it to be.

PAI is part of the journey toward Human 3.0—where humans are augmented by AI to amplify their capabilities.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 🎯 **How Skills Work**

**Skills activate automatically based on your intent:**

- **Say:** "Research the latest AI developments"
  **→** `research` skill loads → Launches parallel Perplexity/Claude/Gemini researchers

- **Say:** "Build a task tracker app"
  **→** `development` skill loads → Invokes architect and engineer agents

- **Say:** "Create a threat model"
  **→** `fabric` skill loads → Selects `create_threat_model` pattern from 242+ options

**Each skill contains:**
- 📄 Intent triggers ("USE WHEN...")
- 🤖 Specialized agents (if needed)
- 🔌 MCP integrations (if needed)
- ⚡ Commands and tools (if needed)
- 📖 Documentation and examples

> [!TIP]
> **You don't manage agents or commands directly.** Just tell PAI what you want to do, and the right skill activates with all necessary resources.

### 💡 **Example Skills (Included)**

| Skill | What It Does | Example Usage |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **🔍 research** | Multi-source research with parallel agents | "Research quantum computing trends" |

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

**Automated Setup:**
```bash
./setup.sh  # Interactive setup script (recommended)
```

**Or read:** [Getting Started Guide](./documentation/how-to-start.md) | [Quick Reference](./documentation/QUICK-REFERENCE.md)

> [!NOTE]
> PAI was originally built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but the architecture supports any AI platform (GPT, Gemini, etc.)
> Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) JavaScript runtime for the current implementation.

### **Manual Installation**

#### **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**

```bash
# Install Bun (JavaScript runtime)
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun 

# Get Claude Code (AI interface)
# Visit: https://claude.ai/code
```

#### **Step 2: Clone PAI Repository**

```bash
# Clone the PAI repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure

# All functional directories are now visible at root
ls -la  # See agents/, skills/, commands/, etc.
```

#### **Step 3: Configure PAI Directory Variable** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You MUST configure the PAI_DIR variable to point to your PAI installation directory.**
> This makes the PAI system completely agnostic to your installation location.

```bash
# Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
# Replace /path/to/PAI with YOUR actual PAI installation path
export PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"  # Point to the PAI repository root
export PAI_HOME="$HOME"  # Your home directory

# Example (adjust to YOUR installation path):
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Projects/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Documents/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="/Users/yourname/PAI"

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Step 4: Configure Environment & API Keys**

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp ${PAI_DIR}/.env.example ${PAI_DIR}/.env

# Configure your API keys
vim ${PAI_DIR}/.env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Some skills and agents require API keys to function:**
>
> **Required for Research Agents:**
> - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - For perplexity-researcher agent ([Get key](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api))
> - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For gemini-researcher agent ([Get key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
> - Claude WebSearch is built-in (no key needed for claude-researcher)
>
> **Optional for AI Generation:**
> - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - For AI image/video generation ([Get key](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens))
> - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT integration and Sora billing ([Get key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
>
> See `.env.example` for complete list and setup instructions.
> **NEVER commit your `.env` file to version control!**

#### **Step 5: Launch PAI**

```bash
# Navigate to PAI directory
cd ${PAI_DIR}

# Optional: Set up voice notifications (macOS only)
# Download Premium/Enhanced voices from System Settings → Voice (Live Speech)
# Then start the voice server:
cd voice-server && bun server.ts &
# See documentation/VOICE-SETUP-GUIDE.md for detailed setup instructions

# Open Claude Code and start using PAI!
# Your personal AI infrastructure is ready 🚀
```

### **⚙️ Environment Variables**

```bash
# ============ REQUIRED CONFIGURATION ============
PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"                  # PAI repository root (system agnostic)
PAI_HOME="$HOME"                        # Your home directory

# ============ RESEARCH AGENTS (Skills-Specific) ============
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_key"          # For perplexity-researcher agent
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"              # For gemini-researcher agent
# Claude WebSearch built-in - no key needed for claude-researcher

# ============ AI GENERATION (Optional) ============
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token"       # For Flux, Sora, etc.
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"              # For GPT integration, Sora billing

# ============ SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ============
PORT="8888"                             # Voice server port (default: 8888)

# ============ DIGITAL ASSISTANT CUSTOMIZATION ============
DA="YourAssistantName"                  # Your AI assistant's name (default: "Assistant")
DA_COLOR="purple"                       # Display color (purple, blue, green, cyan, etc.)
```

> [!TIP]
> **Why PAI_DIR is Important:** The PAI_DIR variable makes the entire PAI system portable and installation-agnostic. All commands, skills, and hooks reference `${PAI_DIR}` instead of hardcoded paths. This means you can install PAI anywhere on your system, and as long as PAI_DIR points to your PAI repository root, everything will work seamlessly.
