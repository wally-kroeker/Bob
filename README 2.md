### Version History

<details>
<summary><strong>📅 v0.7.0 - Agent Observability System & Complete Hooks Infrastructure 🔥 MAJOR UPDATE</strong></summary>

**The Problem:**
Understanding what Claude Code and its agents are doing in real-time is critical for debugging, optimization, and learning. Without visibility into agent behavior, tool usage, and session flow, it's difficult to improve prompts, debug issues, or understand system performance.

**The Solution:**
Complete observability infrastructure with real-time monitoring dashboard and comprehensive event capture system:

**🔍 Agent Observability Dashboard:**
- Real-time WebSocket streaming of all Claude Code events
- Visual monitoring with color-coded agent identification
- Multi-agent session tracking (Kai, Engineer, Architect, Designer, etc.)
- Event timeline with tool usage, sessions, and agent lifecycle
- Server/Client architecture (localhost:4000 / localhost:5172)
- Smart grid layout with responsive design
- Historical event replay and analysis

**📡 Complete Hooks System:**
All 7 Claude Code hook events captured and processed:

1. **SessionStart** - Initialize PAI session, load core context
2. **UserPromptSubmit** - Update tab titles, capture user input
3. **PreToolUse** - Log tool calls before execution
4. **PostToolUse** - Capture tool outputs and results
5. **Stop** - Handle user stops and cleanup
6. **SubagentStop** - Track subagent lifecycle and completion
7. **SessionEnd** - Capture session summaries and learnings
8. **PreCompact** - Context compression events

**🎯 Hook Infrastructure:**
```
~/.claude/hooks/
├── capture-all-events.ts          # Universal event capture (JSONL)
├── initialize-pai-session.ts      # Session initialization
├── update-tab-titles.ts           # Dynamic tab management
├── load-core-context.ts           # Context loading
├── stop-hook.ts                   # Stop event handler
├── subagent-stop-hook.ts          # Subagent lifecycle
├── capture-session-summary.ts     # Session summaries
├── context-compression-hook.ts    # Context management
└── lib/
    └── observability.ts           # Observability integration
```

**💾 Event Logging:**
- Automatic daily JSONL files: `~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_all-events.jsonl`
- Session-to-agent mapping: `~/.claude/agent-sessions.json`
- Agent detection: automatic identification via tool calls, env vars, and path analysis
- PST timestamps with millisecond precision
- Fail-safe: hooks never block Claude Code execution

**🚀 Quick Start:**
```bash
# Start the observability dashboard
~/.claude/scripts/start-observability.sh

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:5172

# Restart dashboard
~/.claude/scripts/restart-observability.sh

# Stop dashboard
~/.claude/scripts/stop-observability.sh
```

**🎨 Agent Color Mapping:**
- Kai (main) → Purple
- Engineer → Green
- Architect → Blue
- Designer → Pink
- Researcher → Yellow
- QA Tester → Orange
- And more...

**Architecture:**
```
Claude Code Events → Hooks (TypeScript) → JSONL Logs
                                       ↓
                              Observability Server (Bun)
                                       ↓
                              WebSocket Stream
                                       ↓
                              React Dashboard (Vite)
```

**What Changed:**
- Added `agent-observability/` system with server/client architecture
- Created 8 TypeScript hooks for all Claude Code events
- Integrated observability library for real-time streaming
- Added 3 management scripts: start, stop, restart
- Configured all hooks in `settings.json` with proper event types
- Added `.env.example` with MCP_API_KEY documentation
- Created session-to-agent mapping system

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Debugging:** See exactly what tools agents are using and when
2. **Learning:** Understand how Claude Code processes your requests
3. **Optimization:** Identify bottlenecks and improve prompts
4. **Multi-Agent Visibility:** Track complex agent interactions
5. **Historical Analysis:** Review past sessions to improve workflows
6. **Real-Time Feedback:** Instant visibility into agent behavior

**Benefits:**
- Complete transparency into Claude Code operations
- Real-time visual feedback during development
- Historical event logs for post-session analysis
- Multi-agent session tracking and visualization
- Fail-safe design - never blocks Claude Code execution
- One-command dashboard startup
- Automatic daily log rotation

<summary><strong>📅 v0.6.0 - Repository Restructure with .claude/ Directory 🔥 MAJOR UPDATE</strong></summary>

**The Problem:**
Users reported issues with PAI not working correctly because the repository structure didn't match the actual working system. The real PAI system expects all infrastructure to live in `~/.claude/`, but the repo had everything at root level. This caused confusion and compatibility problems.

**The Solution:**
Complete repository restructure to mirror the actual working system:
- Created `.claude/` directory at repository root
- Moved ALL PAI infrastructure into `.claude/` (agents, commands, documentation, hooks, skills, voice-server, etc.)
- Kept GitHub infrastructure at root (README, LICENSE, .gitignore, .github, etc.)
- Repository now serves as a true reference implementation

**What Changed:**
```
Before (v0.5.0):
/PAI/
├── agents/
├── commands/
├── documentation/
├── hooks/
├── skills/
├── voice-server/
├── settings.json
├── .mcp.json
├── setup.sh
└── README.md

After (v0.6.0):
/PAI/
├── .claude/                 # ← NEW: All PAI infrastructure here
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── commands/
│   ├── documentation/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── voice-server/
│   ├── settings.json
│   ├── .mcp.json
│   └── setup.sh
├── README.md               # GitHub infrastructure stays at root
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Proper Emulation:** Repository now accurately represents how PAI works in production
2. **Easier Setup:** Users can see exactly how their `~/.claude/` directory should be structured
3. **Less Confusion:** Clear separation between GitHub files and PAI infrastructure
4. **Better Documentation:** Structure itself serves as documentation
5. **Reference Implementation:** Can be copied/referenced directly for setup

**Migration:**
- No action required for existing installations
- New users get the correct structure from the start
- All documentation updated to reflect new paths

**Rationale:**
The PAI system is designed to live in `~/.claude/` on your system. By organizing the repository to mirror this structure, we make it immediately clear how PAI should be set up. This is especially important for new users who are trying to understand the system architecture and for contributors who need to know where files belong.

### 🎯 **How Skills Work**

**Skills activate automatically based on your intent:**

- **Say:** "Research the latest AI developments"
  **→** `research` skill loads → Launches parallel Perplexity/Claude/Gemini researchers

- **Say:** "Build a task tracker app"
  **→** `development` skill loads → Invokes architect and engineer agents

- **Say:** "Create a threat model"
  **→** `fabric` skill loads → Selects `create_threat_model` pattern from 242+ options

**Each skill contains:**
- 📄 Intent triggers ("USE WHEN...")
- 🤖 Specialized agents (if needed)
- 🔌 MCP integrations (if needed)
- ⚡ Commands and tools (if needed)
- 📖 Documentation and examples

> [!TIP]
> **You don't manage agents or commands directly.** Just tell PAI what you want to do, and the right skill activates with all necessary resources.

### 💡 **Example Skills (Included)**

| Skill | What It Does | Example Usage |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **🔍 research** | Multi-source research with parallel agents | "Research quantum computing trends" |

</div>

### **🎯 Hook Events Captured**

PAI hooks into every Claude Code event to provide complete visibility:

| Event | Description | Use Case |
|:------|:------------|:---------|
| **SessionStart** | New Claude Code session begins | Initialize context, set up environment |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | User sends a message | Track requests, update UI |
| **PreToolUse** | Before a tool is executed | Log tool calls, validate inputs |
| **PostToolUse** | After a tool completes | Capture outputs, measure performance |
| **Stop** | User stops execution | Cleanup, save state |
| **SubagentStop** | Subagent completes | Track agent lifecycle, capture results |
| **SessionEnd** | Session terminates | Save summaries, analyze session |
| **PreCompact** | Context compression starts | Monitor token usage, optimize context |

### **🚀 Quick Start: Observability Dashboard**

```

### **📁 Hook Infrastructure**

All hooks are TypeScript-based and located in `~/.claude/hooks/`:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Core Hooks:**
```
capture-all-events.ts      # Universal event capture
initialize-pai-session.ts   # Session bootstrap
update-tab-titles.ts        # Dynamic tab management
load-core-context.ts        # Context loading
```

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Lifecycle Hooks:**
```
stop-hook.ts                # Stop event handler
subagent-stop-hook.ts       # Subagent lifecycle
capture-session-summary.ts  # Session summaries
context-compression-hook.ts # Context management
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Observability Integration:**
```typescript
// hooks/lib/observability.ts
// Sends events to dashboard via WebSocket
// Fails silently if dashboard is offline
// Never blocks Claude Code execution
```

### **💾 Event Logging**

Every event is logged to structured JSONL files for historical analysis:

**Log Location:**
```
~/.claude/history/raw-outputs/
├── 2025-10/
│   ├── 2025-10-26_all-events.jsonl
│   ├── 2025-10-27_all-events.jsonl
│   └── 2025-10-28_all-events.jsonl
└── agent-sessions.json  # Session-to-agent mapping
```

**Event Format:**
```json
{
  "source_app": "engineer",
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "hook_event_type": "PostToolUse",
  "payload": { /* full event data */ },
  "timestamp": 1698765432000,
  "timestamp_pst": "2025-10-26 14:30:32 PST"
}
```

### **🎨 Agent Detection & Color Mapping**

PAI automatically detects which agent is running and assigns colors:

| Agent | Color | Detection Method |
|:------|:------|:-----------------|
| Kai (main) | Purple | Default session |
| Engineer | Green | Task tool + subagent_type |
| Architect | Blue | Task tool + subagent_type |
| Designer | Pink | Task tool + subagent_type |
| Researcher | Yellow | Task tool + subagent_type |
| QA Tester | Orange | Task tool + subagent_type |

**Detection Priority:**
1. Task tool `subagent_type` parameter
2. `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT` environment variable
3. Agent type in payload
4. Path analysis (`/agents/designer/`)
5. Session mapping from previous events

### **🔧 Configuration**

Hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "${PAI_DIR}/hooks/load-core-context.ts" },
          { "type": "command", "command": "${PAI_DIR}/hooks/initialize-pai-session.ts" },
          { "type": "command", "command": "${PAI_DIR}/hooks/capture-all-events.ts --event-type SessionStart" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "${PAI_DIR}/hooks/capture-all-events.ts --event-type PreToolUse" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    // ... 6 more event types
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

**Automated Setup:**
```bash
./.claude/setup.sh  # Interactive setup script (recommended)
```

**Or read:** [Getting Started Guide](./.claude/documentation/how-to-start.md) | [Quick Reference](./.claude/documentation/QUICK-REFERENCE.md)

> [!NOTE]
> PAI was originally built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), but the architecture supports any AI platform (GPT, Gemini, etc.)
> Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) JavaScript runtime for the current implementation.

### **Manual Installation**

#### **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**

```bash
# Install Bun (JavaScript runtime)
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun 

# Get Claude Code (AI interface)
# Visit: https://claude.ai/code
```

#### **Step 2: Clone PAI Repository**

```bash
# Clone the PAI repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure

# All PAI infrastructure is now in .claude/ directory
ls -la .claude/  # See agents/, skills/, commands/, etc.
```

#### **Step 3: Copy .claude/ to Your Home Directory**

```bash
# Copy the .claude directory to your home directory
cp -r .claude ~/.claude

# OR create a symbolic link if you want to keep it in the repo
# ln -s ${PAI_DIR}/.claude ~/.claude
```

#### **Step 4: Configure PAI Directory Variable** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You MUST configure the PAI_DIR variable to point to your PAI installation directory.**
> This makes the PAI system completely agnostic to your installation location.

```bash
# Add to your shell config (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
# Replace /path/to/PAI with YOUR actual PAI installation path
export PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"  # Point to the PAI repository root
export PAI_HOME="$HOME"  # Your home directory

# Example (adjust to YOUR installation path):
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Projects/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="$HOME/Documents/PAI"
# export PAI_DIR="/Users/yourname/PAI"

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

#### **Step 5: Configure Environment & API Keys**

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp ~/.claude/.env.example ~/.claude/.env

# Configure your API keys
vim ~/.claude/.env
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Some skills and agents require API keys to function:**
>
> **Required for Research Agents:**
> - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - For perplexity-researcher agent ([Get key](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api))
> - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For gemini-researcher agent ([Get key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
> - Claude WebSearch is built-in (no key needed for claude-researcher)
>
> **Optional for AI Generation:**
> - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - For AI image/video generation ([Get key](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens))
> - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT integration and Sora billing ([Get key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
>
> See `.env.example` for complete list and setup instructions.
> **NEVER commit your `.env` file to version control!**

#### **Step 6: Launch PAI**

```bash
# Optional: Set up voice notifications (macOS only)
# Download Premium/Enhanced voices from System Settings → Voice (Live Speech)
# Then start the voice server:
cd ~/.claude/voice-server && bun server.ts &
# See ~/.claude/documentation/VOICE-SETUP-GUIDE.md for detailed setup instructions

# Open Claude Code and start using PAI!
# Your personal AI infrastructure is ready 🚀
```

### **⚙️ Environment Variables**

```bash
# ============ REQUIRED CONFIGURATION ============
PAI_DIR="/path/to/PAI"                  # PAI repository root (system agnostic)
PAI_HOME="$HOME"                        # Your home directory

# ============ OBSERVABILITY & HOOKS ============
MCP_API_KEY="your_generated_key"        # For observability dashboard and MCP servers
                                         # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32

# ============ RESEARCH AGENTS (Skills-Specific) ============
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_key"          # For perplexity-researcher agent
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"              # For gemini-researcher agent
# Claude WebSearch built-in - no key needed for claude-researcher

# ============ AI GENERATION (Optional) ============
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_token"       # For Flux, Sora, etc.
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"              # For GPT integration, Sora billing

# ============ SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ============
PORT="8888"                             # Voice server port (default: 8888)

# ============ DIGITAL ASSISTANT CUSTOMIZATION ============
DA="YourAssistantName"                  # Your AI assistant's name (default: "Assistant")
DA_COLOR="purple"                       # Display color (purple, blue, green, cyan, etc.)
```

> [!TIP]
> **Why PAI_DIR is Important:** The PAI_DIR variable makes the entire PAI system portable and installation-agnostic. All commands, skills, and hooks reference `${PAI_DIR}` instead of hardcoded paths. This means you can install PAI anywhere on your system, and as long as PAI_DIR points to your PAI repository root, everything will work seamlessly.
