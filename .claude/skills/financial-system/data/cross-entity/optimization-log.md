## Decisions Pending Bob Analysis

1. **Emergency Fund Target Adjustment**
   - Current assumption: 6 months expenses
   - Consider: Is this realistic given household size/expenses?
   - Bob to analyze after first month of data

2. **Car Maintenance Fund Adequacy**
   - Current: $200/month → $2,400/year
   - Question: Is this sufficient based on historical service costs?
   - Bob to review vehicle maintenance history

3. **Subscription Consolidation**
   - Question: Any duplicate or redundant subscriptions?
   - Bob to analyze subscription list for overlaps

4. **FabLab Funding Level**
   - If GoodFields lands Hydro contract: Can allocate $500-1,000/month
   - If only consulting: Scale down to $100-200/month
   - Decision deferred until revenue clarity
