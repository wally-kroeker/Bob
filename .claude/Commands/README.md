# Custom Slash Commands

This directory contains custom slash commands that extend Claude Code.

## How Slash Commands Work

Files in this directory become available as `/command-name` in Claude Code. For example:
- `example.md` → `/example`
- `my-workflow.md` → `/my-workflow`

## Creating a Slash Command

1. Create a markdown file in this directory
2. The file content becomes the prompt that runs when you invoke the command
3. Use `$ARGUMENTS` to capture any text after the command

### Example: `/summarize`

```markdown
Summarize the following content in 3 bullet points:

$ARGUMENTS
```

Then use it: `/summarize [paste your content here]`

## Built-in Commands

- `/paiupdate` (or `/pa`) - **PAI Update System**: Safely update your PAI installation while preserving your customizations. Your DA analyzes upstream changes and recommends what to adopt.

## Example Commands

- `example.md` - A simple example showing the pattern
