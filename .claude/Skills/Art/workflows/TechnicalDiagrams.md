# Technical Diagram Workflow

**Hand-drawn drafting diagrams using the UL color scheme and Matthew Butterick typography.**

Creates **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS** — hand-drawn engineering sketch style with boxes, arrows, labels, and annotations using Concourse (geometric sans) and Advocate (all-caps display) typeface influences.

---

## Purpose

Technical diagrams explain systems, architectures, processes, and flows. Unlike editorial illustrations (which use abstract metaphors), technical diagrams show **actual structure and relationships**.

**Use this workflow for:**
- System architecture diagrams
- Process flows and pipelines
- Component relationships
- Technical explainers
- Infrastructure maps
- Data flows

## Visual Aesthetic: Hand-Drawn Engineering Sketches

**Think:** Smart engineer's notebook, not polished Visio diagram

### Core Characteristics
1. **Hand-drawn imperfection** — Boxes aren't perfectly straight, lines wobble slightly
2. **Drafting quality** — Looks sketched but intentional, like blueprint drafts
3. **Variable line weight** — Thicker for structure, thinner for annotations
4. **Text is encouraged** — Labels, annotations, component names (unlike editorial)
5. **Typography style** — Concourse geometric sans for labels, Advocate all-caps for titles (hand-drawn interpretation)
6. **Color for meaning** — Strategic use of color to highlight key elements
7. **Grid-aware but imperfect** — Elements roughly aligned but human-drawn

### What This Looks Like
- Boxes with slightly wavy edges
- Arrows that aren't perfectly straight
- Hand-lettered labels in Concourse style (clean geometric sans-serif)
- Diagram title in Advocate style (all-caps, bold, mid-century sports aesthetic)
- Annotations and notes
- Connection lines with human wobble
- Strategic color highlights on important elements

## Typography System: 3-Tier Functional Hierarchy

**THREE typography tiers based on FUNCTION (WHAT/HOW/WHY):**

### **TIER 1: DIAGRAM TITLE (Advocate Block Display)**
**Function:** WHAT — The big idea, main title

- **Font:** Advocate All-Caps Extra Bold
- **Size:** Massive - 3-4x larger than body text (10-15% of diagram vertical space)
- **Usage:** Single diagram title at top
- **Style:** All-caps, hand-lettered, assertive, commands attention
- **Color:** Black #000000 (or Purple #4A148C for extreme emphasis)
- **Example:** "MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE" or "DATA PIPELINE FLOW"

**Visual characteristics:**
- Chunky, bold letterforms
- Mid-century sports team aesthetic
- Immediately establishes what this diagram shows

---

### **TIER 2: COMPONENT LABELS (Concourse Sans Regular)**
**Function:** HOW — Structure, components, mechanics

- **Font:** Concourse Geometric Sans-Serif
- **Size:** Medium - standard readable size
- **Usage:** Box labels, node names, structural elements (80% of text uses this)
- **Style:** Mixed case or sentence case, clean, modern, balanced
- **Color:** Charcoal #2D2D2D (or Black for emphasis)
- **Example:** "API Gateway", "User Authentication", "Database Layer"

**Visual characteristics:**
- Clean geometric sans-serif (inspired by 1930s Metro)
- Perfectly readable at diagram scale
- Professional, technical, no-nonsense
- Hand-drawn interpretation with slight wobble

---

### **TIER 3: ANNOTATIONS & INSIGHTS (Advocate Condensed Italic)**
**Function:** WHY — Commentary, insights, Daniel's voice

- **Font:** Advocate style but condensed/narrower AND italicized
- **Size:** Smaller - 60-70% of Tier 2 size
- **Usage:** Annotations, side notes, explanatory commentary, arrow labels
- **Style:** Italicized to indicate "voice", condensed to save space
- **Color:** Purple #4A148C or Teal #00796B (to distinguish from labels)
- **Example:** "*this is the bottleneck*" or "*where things break*"

**Visual characteristics:**
- Italicized hand-lettered style
- Feels like Daniel's handwritten notes on the diagram
- Adds personality and insight beyond structure
- Strategic placement near relevant components

### **When to Use Each Tier**

| Element Type | Typography Tier | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Diagram title | Tier 1 (Advocate Block) | Establishes context immediately |
| Box/node labels | Tier 2 (Concourse Sans) | Clear functional identification |
| Connection labels | Tier 2 (Concourse Sans) | What flows between components |
| Explanatory notes | Tier 3 (Advocate Italic) | Why this matters, Daniel's insights |
| Warning callouts | Tier 3 (Advocate Italic + Purple) | "*bottleneck*" or "*security issue*" |
| Process steps | Tier 2 (Concourse Sans) | "Step 1:", "Step 2:" |
| Section headers | Tier 1 (Advocate Block, smaller) | "INPUT LAYER", "PROCESSING" |

---

### **Color Coding by Tier**

**Tier 1 (Titles):**
- Default: Black #000000 for authority
- Emphasis: Purple #4A148C when title itself is the key insight

**Tier 2 (Labels):**
- Default: Charcoal #2D2D2D for readability
- Emphasis: Black #000000 for primary components

**Tier 3 (Annotations):**
- Default: Purple #4A148C for Daniel's voice/insights
- Alternative: Teal #00796B for technical annotations
- Creates visual distinction from structural labels

---

## Color System for Technical Diagrams

**Same palette, different usage:**

### Structure (Primary)
```
Black #000000 — Main boxes, containers, primary structure
```

### Emphasis & Highlighting
```
Deep Purple #4A148C — Key components, important nodes, highlights
Deep Teal #00796B — Data flows, connections, secondary emphasis
```

### Annotations
```
Charcoal #2D2D2D — Labels, notes, text annotations
```

### Background
```
White #FFFFFF or Light Cream #F5E6D3 — For clarity and readability
```

### Color Strategy
- **Black linework** for all structural elements (boxes, containers)
- **Purple** to highlight 1-3 most important components
- **Teal** for data flow arrows or connection emphasis
- **Charcoal** for all text/labels
- Sparingly used — not every element needs color

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Extract Technical Structure

**For blog posts or articles:**
1. Read the content
2. Identify the technical system being explained
3. Extract key components, relationships, and flows
4. List them explicitly

**For direct requests ("draw a diagram of X"):**
1. Clarify the system with the user if needed
2. List components and relationships
3. Confirm structure before proceeding

**Output:**
```
COMPONENTS:
- [Component 1 name and role]
- [Component 2 name and role]
- [Component 3 name and role]

RELATIONSHIPS:
- [How components connect]
- [Data flows or dependencies]
- [Key interactions]

EMPHASIS:
- [1-3 most important elements to highlight in purple]
```

---

### Step 2: Design Diagram Structure

**Layout the diagram logically:**

1. **Determine layout type:**
   - Horizontal flow (left to right)
   - Vertical flow (top to bottom)
   - Centered architecture (hub and spoke)
   - Layered architecture (stack diagram)

2. **Arrange components:**
   - What boxes/nodes are needed
   - How they're positioned relative to each other
   - What arrows/connections show

3. **Plan color usage:**
   - Which 1-3 components get purple highlight
   - Which connections get teal emphasis
   - Everything else stays black/charcoal

**Output:**
```
LAYOUT: [Horizontal flow / Vertical flow / Centered / Layered]

DIAGRAM STRUCTURE:
[Describe the arrangement in words, like:
"Top: User box. Middle: Three service boxes (API, Database, Cache) with API in purple. 
Bottom: Storage layer. Arrows showing request flow in teal from User → API → Database."]

COLOR HIGHLIGHTS:
- Purple: [Component name]
- Teal: [Connection/flow description]
```

---

### Step 3: Construct Prompt with UltraThink

**Use extended thinking to create the technical diagram prompt.**

### Prompt Template

```
Hand-drawn technical diagram in engineering notebook / drafting sketch style.

STYLE REFERENCE: Engineering sketch, technical blueprint draft, smart person's notebook drawing

BACKGROUND: [White #FFFFFF OR Light Cream #F5E6D3] — clean, flat, no texture

AESTHETIC:
- Hand-drawn imperfect lines (slightly wobbly, human quality)
- Variable stroke weight (thicker for boxes/structure, thinner for details)
- Boxes and containers with slightly wavy edges (not perfect rectangles)
- Arrows with human imperfection (not perfectly straight)
- Grid-aware layout but hand-drawn (roughly aligned but organic)
- Blueprint/drafting quality — intentional but sketched

DIAGRAM LAYOUT: [Horizontal flow / Vertical stack / Hub-and-spoke / etc.]

COMPONENTS TO DRAW:
[List each box/node with labels, e.g.:]
- [Component 1 name] — Black outlined box, hand-lettered label
- [Component 2 name] — Purple (#4A148C) outlined box with purple label (KEY COMPONENT)
- [Component 3 name] — Black outlined box

CONNECTIONS:
[Describe arrows and flows, e.g.:]
- Arrow from [A] to [B] — Teal (#00796B) with hand-drawn quality
- Dotted line from [C] to [D] — Black, imperfect dots
- Bidirectional arrow between [E] and [F] — Black

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM (3-TIER FUNCTIONAL HIERARCHY):

TIER 1 - DIAGRAM TITLE (Advocate Block Display):
- "[DIAGRAM TITLE IN ALL-CAPS]" — Massive bold all-caps at top
- Font: Advocate style, extra bold, hand-lettered, assertive
- Size: 3-4x larger than body text (10-15% of diagram height)
- Color: Black #000000 (or Purple #4A148C for emphasis)
- Function: Establishes WHAT this diagram shows
- Example: "DATA PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE"

TIER 2 - COMPONENT LABELS (Concourse Sans Regular):
- "[Component Name]", "[Node Label]", "[Box Title]"
- Font: Concourse geometric sans-serif, clean, modern, balanced
- Size: Medium readable size (standard body text)
- Color: Charcoal #2D2D2D (or Black for primary components)
- Function: Identifies HOW the system works (structure, mechanics)
- Example: "API Gateway", "Authentication Service", "Database"

TIER 3 - ANNOTATIONS & INSIGHTS (Advocate Condensed Italic):
- "*this is the bottleneck*", "*where scaling breaks*"
- Font: Advocate style but condensed and italicized
- Size: 60-70% of Tier 2 (smaller, supportive)
- Color: Purple #4A148C (Daniel's voice) or Teal #00796B (technical notes)
- Function: Explains WHY things matter (insights, commentary)
- Example: "*rate limiting happens here*", "*security vulnerability*"

All typography hand-lettered interpretation with slight imperfection

COLOR USAGE:
- Black (#000000) for all primary structure and most elements
- Deep Purple (#4A148C) for [1-3 key components] — outlines and labels
- Deep Teal (#00796B) for [specific flows/connections]
- Charcoal (#2D2D2D) for all text and annotations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Hand-drawn sketch quality — NOT polished vector graphics
- Lines should wobble slightly (human imperfection)
- Text must be readable but hand-lettered style
- Typography: Advocate all-caps for title, Concourse geometric sans for labels (hand-drawn interpretation)
- Boxes not perfectly aligned (roughly grid-aware)
- No gradients, no shadows, flat colors only
- Blueprint/engineering notebook aesthetic
- Strategic color use (not everything colored, mostly black with purple/teal highlights)

[Optional: Add "{{{assistantName}}}" signature in bottom right corner in charcoal]
```

### Step 4: Determine Aspect Ratio

**Choose based on diagram type:**

| Diagram Type | Aspect Ratio | Reasoning |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Horizontal flow | 16:9 or 21:9 | Wide for left-to-right progression |
| Vertical flow | 9:16 or 1:1 | Tall or square for top-to-bottom |
| Centered architecture | 1:1 | Square for hub-and-spoke or centered |
| Layered stack | 16:9 or 1:1 | Wide or square for layer visualization |
| Complex system | 1:1 or 4:3 | Square or slight rectangle for balance |

**Default: 1:1 (square)** — Works for most technical diagrams

---

### Step 5: Execute Generation

```bash
bun run ${PAI_DIR}/Skills/art/tools/generate-ulart-image.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio [1:1 or 16:9 or other] \
  --output /path/to/technical-diagram.png
```

### Model Recommendations

| Model | Best For | Command |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **nano-banana-pro** | Technical diagrams with text | `--model nano-banana-pro` (DEFAULT) |
| **flux** | Maximum quality, complex diagrams | `--model flux` |
| **gpt-image-1** | Simpler diagrams, different style | `--model gpt-image-1` |

**Note:** Unlike editorial illustrations, do NOT use `--remove-bg` — technical diagrams need visible background for clarity.

### Immediately Open

```bash
open /path/to/technical-diagram.png
```

---

### Step 6: Validation (MANDATORY)

**🚨 CRITICAL: Validate the diagram before declaring completion.**

Open the generated image and check ALL criteria:

#### Must Have (ALL REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Hand-drawn quality** — Lines wobble, boxes imperfect, human feel
- [ ] **Readable text** — Labels and annotations are legible
- [ ] **Clear structure** — Diagram shows intended relationships
- [ ] **Strategic color use** — Purple on 1-3 key elements, teal on flows (not everything colored)
- [ ] **Black as primary** — Most elements in black, color is accent
- [ ] **Flat background** — White or cream, no gradients
- [ ] **Blueprint aesthetic** — Looks like engineering sketch, not polished diagram
- [ ] **Technical clarity** — Actually explains the system (not just pretty)

#### Must NOT Have (ALL FORBIDDEN)
- [ ] Perfect straight lines or boxes
- [ ] Polished vector graphic look
- [ ] Gradients or shadows
- [ ] Glossy or 3D effects
- [ ] Illegible text
- [ ] Over-use of color (everything purple/teal)
- [ ] Too messy to understand

#### If Validation Fails — REGENERATE

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Lines too perfect | Emphasize "wobbly imperfect hand-drawn lines, human sketch quality" |
| Text unreadable | Add "clear hand-lettered labels, legible text" |
| Too polished/vector | Strengthen "engineering notebook sketch, NOT polished vector graphics" |
| Wrong colors | Restate color requirements with specific hex codes and usage |
| Too messy | Simplify diagram, fewer components, clearer layout |
| Too much color | "Strategic color use — MOST elements black, purple only on [specific], teal only on [specific]" |
| Looks like AI diagram | Reference "blueprint draft, technical sketch, hand-drawn engineering diagram" |

**Regeneration Process:**
1. Identify failure points
2. Update prompt with specific fixes
3. Regenerate with adjusted prompt
4. Revalidate
5. Repeat until all criteria pass

## Quick Reference

### Key Differences from Editorial Workflow

| Editorial Illustrations | Technical Diagrams |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Abstract metaphors | Actual structure |
| No text | Text encouraged |
| Physical objects/actions | Boxes, arrows, flows |
| 24-item CSE required | Extract components/relationships |
| Square format default | Flexible aspect ratio |
| Background removal | Keep background |
| Narrative journey | System explanation |

### The Technical Diagram Formula

```
1. Extract components and relationships
2. Design diagram structure and layout
3. Plan strategic color usage (purple for key, teal for flow, black for structure)
4. Construct prompt with hand-drawn drafting aesthetic
5. Choose appropriate aspect ratio
6. Generate and validate
7. Regenerate if needed until validation passes
```

### Color Strategy

- **80% Black** — All primary structure
- **10% Purple** — 1-3 most important components
- **5% Teal** — Key flows or connections
- **5% Charcoal** — Text and annotations

---

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: MCP Architecture
**Components:** Client app, MCP server, LLM, Resources
**Layout:** Horizontal flow
**Color:** Purple on MCP server (key component), Teal on connection arrows
**Aspect:** 16:9 (horizontal flow)

### Example 2: Data Pipeline
**Components:** Source, Transform, Load, Storage
**Layout:** Vertical flow with stages
**Color:** Purple on Transform stage, Teal on data flow arrows
**Aspect:** 9:16 (vertical)

### Example 3: System Architecture
**Components:** User, API Gateway, Services, Database
**Layout:** Layered architecture
**Color:** Purple on API Gateway, Teal on request flow
**Aspect:** 1:1 (square, balanced)
