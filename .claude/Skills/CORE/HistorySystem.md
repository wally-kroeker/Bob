# Universal Output Capture System (UOCS) - History System Documentation

**Location:** `${PAI_DIR}/History/`
**Purpose:** Automated documentation of ALL work performed by PAI and specialized agents
**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

---

## Overview

The Universal Output Capture System (UOCS) is PAI's automatic memory - capturing every feature, bug fix, decision, learning, research, and session through hooks with **zero manual effort**.

**Core Principle:** Work normally, documentation handles itself.

---

## Quick Reference

This file is the **complete reference** for the history system. All specifications, conventions, and usage patterns are documented below.

## Directory Structure

```
${PAI_DIR}/History/
├── Sessions/YYYY-MM/          # Session summaries (SessionEnd hook)
├── Learnings/YYYY-MM/         # Problem-solving narratives (Stop hook + manual)
├── Research/YYYY-MM/          # Investigation reports (Researcher agents)
├── Decisions/YYYY-MM/         # Architectural decisions (Architect agent)
├── Execution/
│   ├── Features/YYYY-MM/      # Feature implementations (Engineer/Designer)
│   ├── Bugs/YYYY-MM/          # Bug fixes (Engineer)
│   └── Refactors/YYYY-MM/     # Code improvements (Engineer)

```

**Quick Decision Guide:**
- "What happened this session?" → `Sessions/`
- "What did we learn?" → `Learnings/`
- "What features were built?" → `Execution/Features/`
- "What broke and when?" → `Execution/Bugs/`
- "What was improved?" → `Execution/Refactors/`
- "Why this approach?" → `Decisions/`
- "What did we investigate?" → `Research/`
- "Raw execution logs?" → `Raw-Outputs/`

## File Naming Convention

**Unified format:**
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_[PROJECT]_[TYPE]_[HIERARCHY]_[DESCRIPTION].md
```

**Components:**
- **Timestamp:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` (PST) - Enables chronological sorting
- **Project:** Optional identifier (e.g., `dashboard`, `website`, `PAI`)
- **Type:** Mandatory classification
  - `FEATURE` - New functionality
  - `BUG` - Bug fix
  - `REFACTOR` - Code improvement
  - `RESEARCH` - Investigation
  - `DECISION` - Architectural decision
  - `LEARNING` - Problem-solving narrative
  - `SESSION` - Session summary
- **Hierarchy:** Optional Spec-Kit task number (e.g., `T1.2.3`)
- **Description:** Kebab-case, max 60 chars

**Examples:**
```
2025-10-13-140000_dashboard_FEATURE_T1.1_database-schema-setup.md
2025-10-13-153000_dashboard_BUG_T1.2_jwt-expiry-validation.md
2025-10-13-092000_PAI_DECISION_unified-capture-architecture.md
2025-10-13-083000_LEARNING_kitty-remote-control-api.md

## Hook Integration

### 1. PostToolUse Hook
**Triggers:** Every tool execution (Bash, Edit, Write, Read, Task, etc.)
**Implementation:** `${PAI_DIR}/Hooks/capture-all-events.ts --event-type PostToolUse`
**Output:** Daily JSONL logs in `Raw-Outputs/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_all-events.jsonl`
**Purpose:** Raw execution data for forensics and analytics

**Key Feature:** Completely generic - captures ENTIRE payload automatically
- **Future-proof**: New fields added to hooks (like `agent_id`, `agent_transcript_path` in v2.0.42) are automatically captured
- No code updates needed when Claude Code adds new fields

### 2. Stop Hook
**Triggers:** Main agent (PAI) task completion
**Implementation:** `${PAI_DIR}/Hooks/stop-hook.ts`
**Output:** Auto-captured files in `Learnings/` or `Sessions/` based on content
**Purpose:** Lightweight capture of work summaries and learning moments

**How it works:**
1. Extracts structured response format sections
2. Analyzes for learning indicators (problem, solved, discovered, fixed)
3. Categorizes as LEARNING (2+ indicators) or WORK (general session)
4. Generates appropriate filename and saves to history

### 3. SubagentStop Hook
**Triggers:** Specialized agent task completion
**Implementation:** `${PAI_DIR}/Hooks/subagent-stop-hook.ts`
**Output:** Categorized documents in appropriate directories
**Purpose:** Organized work documentation by agent type

**Categorization Logic:**
- Architect → `Decisions/` (DECISION)
- Engineer/Principal-Engineer → `Execution/Features|Bugs|Refactors/`
- Designer → `Execution/Features/` (FEATURE)
- Researchers (all types) → `Research/` (RESEARCH)
- Pentester → `Research/` (RESEARCH)
- Intern → `Research/` (mixed - defaults to RESEARCH)

**⚠️ Upgrade Note (v2.0.42):**
New fields available in SubagentStop hooks:
- `agent_id` - Unique agent instance identifier
- `agent_transcript_path` - Path to agent transcript

**Status:**
- ✅ `capture-all-events.ts` - Already capturing automatically (generic payload storage)
- ⚠️ `subagent-stop-hook.ts` - Should be updated to explicitly use new fields for better agent tracking

### 4. SessionEnd Hook
**Triggers:** Session exit (when you quit Claude Code)
**Implementation:** `${PAI_DIR}/Hooks/capture-session-summary.ts`
**Output:** Session summary in `Sessions/YYYY-MM/`
**Purpose:** High-level session documentation

### 5. SessionStart Hook
**Triggers:** Session initialization (when you start Claude Code)
**Implementation:** `${PAI_DIR}/Hooks/initialize-kai-session.ts`
**Purpose:** Load core context and prepare session environment

## Custom Slash Commands

### /search-history [query]
**Purpose:** Full-text search across all history
**Example:** `/search-history authentication bug`
**Implementation:** Uses ripgrep with context lines

### /show-project-history [project]
**Purpose:** Chronological timeline for project
**Example:** `/show-project-history dashboard`
**Output:** Most recent 30 files for project

### /trace-feature [task-number]
**Purpose:** Complete implementation history for task
**Example:** `/trace-feature T1.2`
**Output:** Features, bugs, refactors related to task

### /bug-timeline [feature]
**Purpose:** Bug introduction and fix timeline
**Example:** `/bug-timeline authentication`
**Output:** Chronological list of related bugs

---

## Integration with Spec-Kit

**Spec-Kit** (`.specify/`) = PLAN (what to do)
**UOCS** (`History/`) = REALITY (what was done)

### Bidirectional Traceability

**From Spec to History:**
```
.specify/specs/001-auth/tasks.md
└─ T005 [US1] Implement login endpoint

History/Execution/Features/2025-10/
└─ 2025-10-13-140000_myapp_FEATURE_T005_login-endpoint.md
```

**From Bug to Feature:**
```
History/Execution/Features/2025-10/
└─ 2025-10-13-140000_myapp_FEATURE_T1.2_user-model.md
    ↓ (bug introduced here)
History/Execution/Bugs/2025-10/
└─ 2025-10-13-153000_myapp_BUG_T1.2_unique-constraint.md
    (metadata: bug_introduced_by: T1.2)
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### Before Starting Work

```bash
# Has this been done before?
/search-history [feature-name]

# How did we build similar features?
/trace-feature T1

# What decisions were made about this?
ls ${PAI_DIR}/History/Decisions/*/[project]_*

# What did we learn about this domain?
/search-history [domain-term]
```

### During Development

**No action required** - work normally, everything captured automatically.

### After Encountering Issues

```bash
# When did this break?
/bug-timeline [feature-name]

# Complete history of this feature
/trace-feature T1.2.3

# What similar bugs have we fixed?
/search-history "[bug description]"
```

### Periodic Review

```bash
# What did we accomplish this week?
ls -lt ${PAI_DIR}/History/Sessions/2025-10/ | head -7

# All decisions made this month
ls ${PAI_DIR}/History/Decisions/2025-10/

# Learnings from this quarter
ls ${PAI_DIR}/History/Learnings/2025-{10,11,12}/
```

find ${PAI_DIR}/History/Execution/Features -name "*_dashboard_*"
```

### Find bugs introduced in specific task
```bash
rg "bug_introduced_by: T1.2" ${PAI_DIR}/History/Execution/Bugs/
```

### Find all work from specific date
```bash
find ${PAI_DIR}/History -name "2025-10-13-*"
```

### Analyze tool usage patterns
```bash
cat ${PAI_DIR}/History/Raw-Outputs/2025-10/*.jsonl | \
  jq -r '.tool' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Extract all architectural decisions
```bash
find ${PAI_DIR}/History/Decisions -name "*.md" | \
