Red River Mutual
Winnipeg, MB

Dear Arun,

I am writing to express my interest in the Security Analyst position at Red River Mutual. Jean Dalman mentioned this opportunity and encouraged me to apply. With 20+ years of hands-on cybersecurity experience including security operations, incident response, and vulnerability management across enterprise environments, I am confident I can contribute immediately to your security operations team.

My hands-on experience aligns strongly with this role's requirements. I have daily experience with security event triage using Microsoft Defender XDR and SIEM/MDR platforms, developing incident response playbooks and leading security investigations, conducting continuous vulnerability scanning and coordinating remediation with infrastructure teams, implementing zero-trust segmentation and Cisco ISE deployment, and automating security workflows using PowerShell and KQL. I have managed security controls across hybrid Azure cloud environments.

Beyond operational security, my background includes enterprise architecture experience—both infrastructure architecture (designing VMware/SAN environments, hybrid cloud deployments) and security architecture (zero-trust frameworks, identity architecture, defense-in-depth design). I have worked extensively with the CIS Critical Controls framework and am familiar with NIST Cybersecurity Framework implementation and how these frameworks map to each other. This broader perspective allows me to contribute not just to the security operations team, but to strategic security initiatives like NIST framework alignment across Red River Mutual's IT organization.

I am a Manitoba resident (Elie, MB) and deeply value Red River Mutual's commitment to employees and the local community. I am seeking a role where I can apply my security operations expertise to protect an organization that genuinely cares about its people.

I am available immediately and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Red River Mutual's cybersecurity program. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Wally Kroeker
