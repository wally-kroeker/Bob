# Wawanesa - Advanced Analytics & ML Architect
## Bob's Honest Assessment

**MVP Result**: SKIP (another false positive)
**Bob's Take**: This is the WRONG role for you

---

## Why This Looks Good (But Isn't)

### Green Flags That Catch Your Eye
- ✅ **"Architect"** in the title - matches your identity
- ✅ **Winnipeg or Calgary** - Go home to Tiph
- ✅ **$115k-$157k** - Excellent salary range
- ✅ **Hybrid work** - 2 days/week in office
- ✅ **Architecture focus** - Not operational work
- ✅ **"Hub-and-spoke model"** - Leadership/guidance role
- ✅ **Standards and governance** - Your wheelhouse

### Why You'd Be Tempted
This feels like what you WANT to be doing:
- Strategic architecture work
- Setting standards and patterns
- Guiding teams
- Enterprise architecture frameworks
- Long-term roadmaps

---

## The Critical Problem: 80% Skills Mismatch

### What This Job Actually Requires

**Core Focus: Data & ML Architecture**
- AWS-native data lakes
- MLOps pipelines (MLflow, SageMaker)
- Advanced analytics platforms
- Machine learning infrastructure
- Feature stores
- Data modeling and architecture
- AI/ML compliance and governance

### What You Actually Have

**Core Focus: Security & Infrastructure Architecture**
- Network security architecture
- Zero-trust implementation
- OT/SCADA security
- Incident response
- Penetration testing
- Security operations

### The Overlap: ~20%

**Where you match:**
- Architecture design methodology
- Enterprise architecture frameworks
- Standards and governance
- Cloud architecture (AWS experience)
- Technical leadership
- Stakeholder communication

**Where you DON'T match:**
- ML/Analytics domain expertise
- Data engineering patterns
- MLOps tooling
- Statistical modeling knowledge
- Data lake architecture
- AI/ML regulatory compliance specifics

---

## The Harsh Truth

### You're a Security Architect, Not a Data Architect

**This role needs someone who:**
- Lives and breathes data pipelines
- Understands ML model deployment patterns
- Has built MLOps platforms
- Knows feature engineering
- Speaks the language of data scientists

**You're someone who:**
- Lives and breathes security
- Understands threat models and attack surfaces
- Has built security operations centers
- Knows vulnerability management
- Speaks the language of security teams

**These are DIFFERENT specializations.**

---

## Why You'd Fail This Interview

**Question**: "Walk us through how you'd architect our MLOps pipeline for model deployment at scale."

**Your honest answer**: "I haven't built MLOps pipelines. I've built security architectures."

**Question**: "How would you design our feature store architecture to support real-time and batch inference?"

**Your honest answer**: "I'd need to research that - my background is security architecture, not ML infrastructure."

**Question**: "What's your experience with SageMaker Pipelines vs MLflow for model lifecycle management?"

**Your honest answer**: "I'm familiar with cloud platforms from a security perspective, but not ML-specific tooling."

**Result**: They'd see immediately you're the wrong fit.

---

## The Qualifications Gap

### What They Want
- **10 years full life cycle solution design** - You have this
- **2-5 years IT architecture experience** - You have this
- **Object-oriented analysis and design** - You have this
- **MLOps tools experience** - **You DON'T have this**
- **Data and ML platform design** - **You DON'T have this**
- **Advanced analytics solutions** - **You DON'T have this**

### What "Asset" Means in This Context
- "Knowledge of MLOps tools is an asset" = **This is actually REQUIRED**
- "Insurance industry experience is an asset" = This is the actual optional part

**Translation**: If you don't have MLOps experience, you're not getting the job.

---

## Could You Learn It?

**Technically**: Yes, you're smart enough to learn ML/analytics architecture.

**Realistically**:
- It would take 6-12 months of focused study
- You'd be behind in the interview against data architects
- You'd be drinking from a firehose in the first year
- It's a career pivot, not a career continuation

**Strategically**:
- You need income NOW, not after 6 months of studying
- GoodFields positioning is SECURITY consulting, not ML consulting
- Your network effects (W13) are in security, not data/ML

---

## Why This Feels Appealing (And Why That's Dangerous)

### The Trap

**This job activates your identity**: "I'm an architect! I do strategic work!"

**But it ignores the specifics**: Architecture of WHAT matters.

**Analogy**:
- A cardiac surgeon and a neurosurgeon are both "surgeons"
- Both do strategic, high-skill surgical work
- But you don't want the cardiac surgeon operating on your brain

**You're a Security Architect applying for a Data/ML Architect role.**

**Same job family, DIFFERENT specialty.**

---

## What Would Actually Happen If You Applied

**Best case scenario**:
- You get an interview
- They ask ML-specific questions
- You're honest about your background
- They say "thanks but we need ML expertise"
- You've wasted 2-3 weeks in the hiring process

**Worst case scenario**:
- You somehow get the job (unlikely)
- First 6 months are brutal (imposter syndrome + actual skill gap)
- You're stressed, underwater, and still not bringing in GoodFields income
- You realize you're in the wrong role but now locked into a job

---

## Bob's Recommendation: SKIP THIS

**This is not your lane.**

**Look for roles with these titles instead:**
- Security Architect
- Cybersecurity Architect
- Infrastructure Security Architect
- Cloud Security Architect
- Enterprise Security Architect
- Zero Trust Architect

**NOT:**
- Data Architect
- ML Architect
- Analytics Architect
- AI/ML Solutions Architect

## What You SHOULD Look For

Based on your actual skills and the Red River Mutual comparison:

### Ideal Role Characteristics
1. **Security focus** (not data/ML)
2. **Architecture level** (not operations)
3. **Winnipeg/Manitoba** (go home to Tiph)
4. **Clear scope** (defined deliverables)
5. **Hybrid or contract** (flexibility for GoodFields)

### Target Job Titles
- Security Architect (permanent)
- Cybersecurity Consultant (contract)
- Security Advisory Services (consulting)
- Infrastructure Security Architect
- OT/ICS Security Architect (your Qualico specialty)

### Red River Mutual Comparison

**Red River Mutual** (Security Analyst):
- ✅ Security focus (your wheelhouse)
- ❌ Operational work (not architecture)
- ✅ Winnipeg
- ✅ 100% skills match
- ❌ Not the strategic role you want

**Wawanesa** (ML Architect):
- ❌ ML/Data focus (not your expertise)
- ✅ Architecture work
- ✅ Winnipeg or Calgary
- ❌ 20% skills match
- ❌ Would require 6+ months to be competent

**What you ACTUALLY need**:
- ✅ **Security** focus
- ✅ **Architecture** level
- ✅ Winnipeg/Manitoba
- ✅ 80%+ skills match
- ✅ Can start contributing day 1

## Strategic Advice: Don't Apply to Jobs You Can't Do

**From Saturday's conversation**, you're dealing with:
- Imposter syndrome
- Rejection sensitivity
- Financial desperation
- Relationship stress

**Applying to jobs where you're genuinely unqualified will:**
- Confirm your worst fears about yourself (when you get rejected)
- Waste emotional energy on dead-end interviews
- Delay finding work you can actually succeed in
- Trigger more rejection sensitivity when they say no

**Instead:**
- Apply to security roles where you'd dominate
- Focus on 80%+ skills match
- Build confidence through roles you can win
- Save ML/analytics pivot for when you have stability

---

## The One Exception: If You WANT to Pivot to ML

**If you're thinking**: "Actually, I've always wanted to get into ML/AI architecture..."

**Then**:
1. Don't apply to this job yet
2. Spend 3-6 months learning MLOps, data lakes, analytics platforms
3. Build a portfolio project (deploy an ML model pipeline)
4. THEN apply to junior ML architect roles
5. Accept that it's a career restart, not continuation

**But that's NOT what you need right now** given G1/R1 situation.

---

## Bottom Line

**Wawanesa ML Architect**: HARD SKIP

**Why**: 80% skills mismatch, would fail interview, wrong specialty

**What to do instead**: Keep looking for Security Architect or Security Consulting roles in Winnipeg/Manitoba.

**Red River Mutual Security Analyst remains your best option so far** - operational not architecture, but at least it's security work you can actually do.

---

**You're a Security Architect. Own it. Find security architecture work.**

**Don't apply to data/ML roles because the title says "architect" - the domain matters more than the job family.**
