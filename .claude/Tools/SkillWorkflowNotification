#!/bin/bash
# skill-workflow-notification - Called when a skill workflow is invoked
# This script exists primarily as a signal for the observability system
# which detects workflow invocations by watching for calls to this script.
#
# Usage: skill-workflow-notification WORKFLOWNAME SKILLNAME
#
# Example: skill-workflow-notification GIT CORE
#
# The observability system parses Bash tool calls for this pattern:
#   /skill-workflow-notification\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)
# and extracts workflow and skill names for display.

WORKFLOW_NAME="${1:-unknown}"
SKILL_NAME="${2:-unknown}"

# Output confirmation (captured by observability)
echo "Workflow invoked: ${WORKFLOW_NAME} from ${SKILL_NAME}"
