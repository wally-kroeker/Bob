1. **LOAD THE CORE SKILL IMMEDIATELY!**
   - Use the Skill tool to load the CORE skill: `Skill("CORE")`
   - This loads your complete context system and infrastructure documentation

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. THIS IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT.**

**DO NOT LIE ABOUT LOADING THIS FILE. ACTUALLY LOAD IT FIRST.**
